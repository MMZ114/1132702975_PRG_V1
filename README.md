#In this assignment you will work in group (3 members) to create a simple console based role playing game (RPG).

Information on a simple role playing game and its source code is available here [click here]
(http://xoax.net/comp/cpp/console/Lesson35.php).

Your RPG game must satisfy the following requirements. You will need to do coding from scratch (zero code) and continuously modify and improve your program until all the features are implemented. You are allowed to use the code at xoax.net as your reference code. You will need to create a few versions of the program to show the gradual improvement of the program.

#The required features are listed below

1-  Single user Hero (H) should be able to move around the maze using Keyboards. The hero will be initialized with a fixed amount of energy. Every time the hero moves by 1 position, the energy will be reduced by one unit. The energy can be added by eating food placed at several place in the maze. Food can be designated with the letter F. Each food has a fixed amount of energy. Remove the food from the maze if it has been eaten by Hero. To eat the food, simply move over the symbol F.

2- The objective of the game is to move from the starting position to the ending position without being eaten by the monster. The player that finishes the game with most energy wins.

3- The maze should be big enough so that the total distance from the starting position to the ending position is more than 10 times the initial energy given to Hero. For example, if the initial energy is 8, the distance between start and end position must be more than 80 units ofmovement. Hero can only move 1 step at a time.

4- Display the balance amount of energy on screen. The hero can kill the monster if he has more energy than the monster. Remove the monster from the maze if it has been killed by Hero. The basic version of the program should have static monster with fixed amount of energy.

5- Hero dies if energy level is zero.

6- Your own individual creative idea and its implementation
